# Robot Arm Project
## Planning
### Outline
Our goal is to create a robot arm that is like a claw machine and picks up nerds with a little bucket. The bucket will split in half and open and close using a servo and gears. The box will be 5x5 with an open area that’s like a pool. We will fill the pool up with nerds as they are a light candy so our arm won’t have to hold too much weight. Our robot arm will have 4 servos that help the arm with picking up motions, on will be on the bucket to make it open and close, one will be on what would be the wrist, and two will be on the base, one will move the bottom joint forwards and backward and the other will use links to move the second-lowest joint. There will be gears on the bucket and it’ll help the bucket open up like claws so it can pick up the nerds using only one servo. Our biggest concern is the amount of time we have to complete this project, we will have to manage our time well to finish this in time. Our other concern is that the arm will not be strong enough to hold its own weight plus the weight of the nerds so we will have to design it in a way to maximize its strength.
